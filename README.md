Neuro-Sand-Cube-Console
=======================

Web server and monitoring console for the Neuro-Sand-Cube environment

## Overview

The Neuro-Sand-Cube (NSC) is a cyber-physical system (CPS) based on an augmented version of the Platinum Arts Studio Sandbox, which is itself based on the Cube 2 engine. It was designed to assist neuroscientists with CPS-based research.

This console runs independent of the CPS and displays real-time event data streaming out of the NSC

No security is desired or implemented. The intention is ease-of-use above all. Therefore, the console is designed for operation inside private networks only.
